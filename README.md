# hanabi-rl

This is a simple project to start investigating using reinforcement learning to play Hanabi. Although this is an area of active study by full-time researchers, my goal is to create some simple models for my own edification. Two questions drive these initial studies:
(1) Does a self-playing model develop similar conventions to human players, such as the front-play/back-discard convention?
(2) Can a model be developed which makes playing Hanabi with two humans into a fun, if not an always-winnable, experience?

There is another, more minor, naive question: do different strategies develop if there is an extra weight given to winning the game instead of getting a score of 24 or so out of 25?
